  # This setting ensures that at least one instance of your application is
  # always running. This prevents long "cold starts" when accessing the app
  # after a period of inactivity, but may have cost implications.
  minInstances: 1
  # Increase this value if you'd like to automatically spin up
  # more instances in response to increased traffic.
